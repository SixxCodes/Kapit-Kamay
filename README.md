# Kapit-Kamay

## 1. Project Idea
- Website Name: Kapit Kamay 
- One-liner Pitch:
•	"Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan," a website where students and communities help each other, hand in hand.

## 2. Purpose

### What is the website for?
•	Students find part-time jobs, while families, businesses, and organizations find the help they need — making everyday tasks lighter and offering opportunities for growth on both sides.

### Inspiration behind this idea:
•	Many students need part-time work to support their education and gain experiences, while many communities need extra hands for small tasks, services, or projects. Together, they lift each other.
•	Many companies today value both degrees and experience. Even if a student has a diploma, lacking experience can make it harder to get hired. Through Kapit Kamay, students can build skills, gain real-world experience, and prove their reliability — even before they graduate.

### What problem does it solve or what opportunity does it take advantage of?
•	**Students**: Earn money for tuition, daily needs, or gain work experience.
•	**Communities**: Find trustworthy, affordable, energetic help easily.
•	It promotes a spirit of bayanihan (Filipino value of community cooperation).

## 3. Key Features

### What are the plan features or what does your website can do?
•	**Register/Login System** (Separate roles: Student / Community)
•	**Post a Task / Job** (For community users: title, description, location, optional payment)
•	**View Available Tasks** (For students: list of jobs/tasks)

•	**Search and filter** jobs/tasks by location or type.

### Show an existing website that is identical to your idea
•	**TaskRabbit** - connects people who need help with tasks (like moving, cleaning, repairs) to individuals who can offer their services.

### Specify at least 1 any unique or innovative feature or what makes your site Different
•	**TaskRabbit** is more business-focused, while Kapit Kamay focuses on community support and youth empowerment.
•	Community-driven and youth-centered.
•	Instead of focusing purely on money, Kapit Kamay allows communities and students to work together for growth, education, and social good, proving that "Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan."
•	**New Unique Feature**:
o	**“Trust Points”** for Students
o	Whenever a student completes a task, they earn Trust Points — like a small recognition system, showing communities they can be trusted with future jobs.
o	Students can build a simple "Trust Score" on their profile along with the ratings!
**Example**: Juan Dela Cruz — 120 Impact Points earned!

## 4. Target Audience
